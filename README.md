### Why did you choose Berkeley for graduate school?

I had a good feeling about it, and I liked the professors I talked to during visit day.

I also remember I went running the day after arriving, and I went up that road toward Berkeley Lab, and there was a little herd of deer, including some baby deer. It was maybe 7:30 in the morning, and no one else was out. So, that was a great moment.

### What was your reaction when you first started interacting with ChatGPT? Were you surprised at how well it worked?

I would say that I saw the models gradually change and gradually improve. One funny detail is that GPT-4 was done training before we released ChatGPT, which is based on GPT-3.5 — a weaker model. So at the time, no one at OpenAI was that excited about ChatGPT because there was this much stronger, much smarter model that had been trained. We had also been beta testing the chat model on a group of maybe 30 or 40 friends and family, and they basically liked it, but no one really raved about it.

So, I ended up being really surprised at how much it caught on with the general public. And I think it’s just because it was easier to use than models they had interacted with before of similar quality. And [ChatGPT] was also maybe slightly above threshold in terms of having lower hallucinations, meaning it made less stuff up and had a little more self-awareness. I also think there is a positive feedback effect, where people show each other how to use it effectively and get ideas by seeing how other people are using it.

Technology = source of competitive advantage:  
- scale a business (globally) 
- cut cost and get more productive
- work with urgency 

Challenges right now: 
- pandemic 
- inflation 
- interest rates 
- geopolitics 
- supply-chain 
- cybersecurity 

2 Transformative Technologies 
- Hybrid Cloud
  - 77% of businesses prefer this architecture  
  - RedHat OpenShift platform supports containers built on open-source 
- AI 
  - 2017-23 AI use 2x (30-40% in use) 
  - expected to unlock $16T work/productivity...how? 
  - enterprise: HR, pricing, supply-chain, inventory,..., all the processes to run a business
    - needs to be accurate at such a large-scale  
    - 70% ppl in software involved in maintenance and operations; if that's cut down to 30% then productivity will rise 
    - SAP has embedded Watson AI as a natural langugage interface on -
  - consumer: 


Quantum Computing 
- not science fiction lol 
- IBM has over 20 real quantum computers accessible on cloud and for anyone to use
